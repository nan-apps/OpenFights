OpenFights is a simple opensource fighting game

You can attack or defend. Fire and shield increase holding down the button that triggers them.
When bigger the bullet bigger the damage. And when bigger the shield, bigger the defense.

You can forkit or play here: http://openfights.nan-apps.com/

I make also a fork of this game using dinasours sprites and adding more features to the game.
It's call ClonoLuchas and you can find it here: https://github.com/nan-apps/clonoluchas
